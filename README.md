Automated Receipt Organizer â€“ AWS AI/Serverless Project
Project Overview
Keeping track of paper receipts manually is time-consuming and disorganized. I wanted to build a fully automated cloud system where:

Receipts could be uploaded easily

Important data (vendor, date, total) would be extracted automatically

Data would be stored neatly in a database

Email summaries would be sent without manual work

The solution needed to be scalable, serverless, and fit within AWS Free Tier limits.

How It Works
Built an end-to-end serverless system using AWS services:

Amazon S3: Upload and store receipt images (Incoming folder)

AWS Lambda (Python 3.9): Orchestrate receipt processing

Amazon Textract: Extract text data from receipt files

Amazon DynamoDB: Store extracted receipt metadata

Amazon SES: Email summarized receipt details to the user

AWS IAM: Manage permissions and secure service communication

Workflow Summary:

A user uploads a receipt to the S3 Incoming folder.

S3 triggers a Lambda function automatically.

Lambda processes the receipt with Textract.

Extracted details are saved to DynamoDB.

An email summary is sent through SES.

Tech Stack

Key Lessons Learned
Gained experience integrating multiple AWS services together

Managed IAM roles for secure communication between cloud services

Learned to extend Lambda timeouts for heavy Textract operations

Practiced setting up S3 Event Notifications and Lambda triggers
